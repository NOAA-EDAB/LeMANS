\usage{
calc_sizepref_suitability(nSize, nSpecies, mBound, spMu, spSigma, wgt,
  scLinf, FW)
}
\arguments{
\item{nSize}{Number of size class intervals species can grow through}

\item{nSpecies}{Number of species in the model}

\item{mBound}{Mid point of each size class interval}

\item{spMu}{Mean of log normal distribution}

\item{spSigma}{Standard deviation of the log normal distribution}

\item{wgt}{Weight of species at the mid point of each size class (Units: grams)}

\item{scLinf}{The size class at which each species reaches L_inf (maximum length)}

\item{FW}{Food web represented as a binary matrix. Predator (columns) and prey (rows). See \code{\link{data_foodweb}}}
}
\value{
A list is returned

\description{
Calculates the lognormal probability functions for prey preferences, based on the predator/prey size (wgt) ratio.
Returns a 3D matrix with the (prey/predator) body size ratio for predator of size i, species j, and prey size k species l.
